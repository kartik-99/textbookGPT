# PDF-based Conversational Chatbot using LangChain

This project showcases a PDF-based conversational chatbot built using Python and LangChain. The chatbot can read any textbook in PDF format and help users understand the concepts explained in it. The application uses OpenAI's GPT API to process questions and maintain chat history!

With more leasure time, I will try to add more features/optimisations

## Features

- Extracts text from a PDF file.
- Splits the extracted text into manageable chunks.
- Stores text chunks in a Chroma vector database.
- Uses LangChain to create a conversational retrieval chain.
- Maintains chat history to provide contextually relevant responses.

TextbookGPT     : To improve your leadership skills, you can follow these tips from the book:

1. **Avoid confusing passion with authority:** Do not be overly emotional as it may convey passion but not confidence or authority.
   
2. **Do not yell or raise your voice:** This can lead to a loss of respect and hinder your ability to lead effectively.
   
3. **Be respectful of everyone:** Ignoring someone can diminish your influence as a leader.
   
4. **Stay humble:** Humility is a powerful trait for effective leadership as it helps in connecting with people.
   
5. **Have a clear, simple, and organized vision:** Complex and disorganized strategies are less likely to be followed.
   
6. **Understand the mechanics of leadership:** Know when to ask for input and when to dictate, as this can impact your effectiveness as a leader.
   
7. **Make others feel important:** Charisma can be generated by making others feel special and valued.
   
8. **Allow for flexible leadership styles:** Adapt your leadership style based on the level of participation needed from your followers.
